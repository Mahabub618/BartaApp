This project is aimed to developing an **android** Online Chatting System. Chatting or teleconferencing, is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas “together” despite of the geographical barriers. The technology has been available for years but the acceptance it was quite recent. Our project is an example of a chat server application, which runs on the user’s android device and server application.
